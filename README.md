# Manchester United Quiz

Manchester United Quiz is an online trivia quiz. The user is given a set of questions and a set of 4 multiple choice answers. As the user progresses through the quiz their score is incrementally tallied to reflect the answers they have got correct and incorrect, thus letting the user know if they have correctly answered the question. 

The quiz has a set of intermediate to more challenging questions depending on the age of the user and their knowledge of the Football club. Consequently, the quiz is targetted to an audience of older users, however, it can also be suited to younger players who have a deep interest in Manchester United.

## Design 

The approach in the design of this site was intended to allow users to enjoy a clear, simple and appropriately themed quiz game tests users knowledge on trivia questions around the football club of Manchester United. This website would therefore be primarily targetted for Manchester United fans and football fans in general, secondary.

The website is created to entertain Manchester United fans and test their knowledge of the club. I did this by incorporating themes and the badge  of the club in order to ensure the attractiveness of the website.

## Features and Functionality

The site has one main page and your initial visual upon entering the site are the Manchester United badge, a header explaining the use of the site, a container prompting you to start the quiz and a score tally. When the user initiates the start button, they will then be greeted by a question and a set of buttons to give the answer they wish. As they go through the quiz their score shall be incrementally tallied depended on the answers they give.

Upon completion of the quiz, the user shall be notified that the quiz is complete and all the question shall be printed under the container.
